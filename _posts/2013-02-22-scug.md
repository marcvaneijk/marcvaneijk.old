**UPDATE 28-2-2013**: The Dutch System Center User Group Event has been rescheduled for April 18th, 2013. This is in the same week as the Dutch Hyper-v.nu Event. Two great event in one week and both for free, what more can you ask for.

~~On March the 5th~~ the Dutch System Center User Group Event will take place.  The event is hosted by HP in Amstelveen. The presentations are in Dutch and I also have the privilege of presenting a session.

In this session I will explain the new networking features of System Center VMM 2012 SP1 (VM Networks and the Logical Switch).
