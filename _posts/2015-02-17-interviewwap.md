Besides his mobile datacenter, Carsten Rachfahl  also brings his recording equipment to every event. He asked me for an interview a couple of times but we never got round to it. At the Technical Summit in Berlin I met with Carsten and we finally got some time to talk. Check out the recording [here](http://www.it-cast.de/hyperv/video-interview-with-marc-van-eijk-about-windows-azure-pack/)

Did you ever have a look at all the work Carsten is doing? It’s just unbelievable. As an Hyper-V MVP he makes podcasts, interviews, blog posts, presents at events and also finds some time to works. We did a [podcast](http://www.hyper-v-server.de/pod_cast/microsoft-virtualisierungs-podcast-folge-36-windows-azure-pack/) on Windows Azure Pack about a year ago.

Carsten’s blog is in German, but still very interesting to check out. Have a look at [here](http://www.hyper-v-server.de/).
