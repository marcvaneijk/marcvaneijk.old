1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number

4. And another item.  

   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

# Links

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

# Syntax highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks` around it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks  ``` , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

```
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

# Tables

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

# Blocknotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
