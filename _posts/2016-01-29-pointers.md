Azure Resource Manager templates

After the installation you can test deployments with Azure Resource Manager templates. There is a huge community contributing to templates on GitHub. There are two GitHub repositories that are useful to start with.

Azure quickstart templates: http://github.com/Azure/Azure-QuickStart-Templates (Some templates might have resources types in it that are not available in Microsoft Azure Stack TP)

AzureStack quickstart templates: http://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates (These templates have been authored specifically for the resource types in Microsoft Azure Stack TP)

Feedback

When you are working with the Microsoft Azure Stack TP, you can run into things that you believe can be improved. You might be missing certain features or resource providers. Microsoft is very interested in hearing your feedback. You can directly submit your feedback to the Product Group on the User voice.

Based on my personal experience I can ensure you that the Product Group prioritizes their development efforts based on your feedback on user voice. I encourage you to have a look. I know I’m definitely going to use it.

Enjoy your journey with Microsoft Azure Stack. You’re life will never be the same without it :)
