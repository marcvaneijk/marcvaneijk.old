A couple of days ago I posted a [blog](/2013/12/24/community) about the mindset of the community. What I did not talk about in that blog is the mindset of Microsoft employees. I have worked with many of them over the last year and they all share the same mentality. They are driven to get the most out of the products that they develop and embrace anyone that has that same goal.

I have spend many evenings working with developers on issues we encountered, spoke with program managers about possible future features, or just did some rambling with a support engineer. We share the same interest. Passion for the solution. I have a lot of them on Lync and some of them seem to have a green color coded in. They just never sleep.

Today I got an email that I did not expect. Yeah, I was nominated (a big thank you to Michel Gebbinck) and I had to fill in a form. But becoming an MVP is something else. You can become MVP in many categories. Most of you know I have a strong interest in Windows Azure Pack. I was always wondering in what category that would fit. Now we know.

MVP

What a great way to start 2014. Iâ€™m very honored by this award. Thanks to everyone at Microsoft that I have had the privilege to work with last year and my favorite color has been set.
