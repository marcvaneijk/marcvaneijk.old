title: Windows Server 2012 R2 and System Center 2012 R2 â€“ Hyper-V Network Virtualization Whitepaper

My [first post](/2012/08/24/hnv) on [hyper-v.nu](http://www.hyper-v.nu/) was on Network Virtualization. The technology was unknown to most at the time and the information was scarce. Nevertheless the possibilities of the solution looked very promising. Now, more than a year later, Network Virtualization has evolved. Windows Server 2012 R2 provides all the building blocks to run Network Virtualization in a production environment. With a lot of moving components Network Virtualization might seem daunting.

To reduce the complexity, a couple of community members have put a lot of effort in collecting the proper information, testing implementations and with the input from the relevant product teams they have written a whitepaper to get you started with Network Virtualization. The whitepaper is created by [Kristian Nese (MVP CDM)](http://twitter.com/KristianNese) and [Flemming Riis (MVP CDM)](http://twitter.com/FlemmingRiis) and was reviewed by [Daniel Neumann (MVP CDM)](http://twitter.com/neumanndaniel) and [Stanislav Zhelyazkov (MVP CDM)](http://twitter.com/StanZhelyazkov). I had the pleasure of exchanging ideas and experiences with them.

If you want to get started with Network Virtualization this whitepaper is a great way. It provides an excellent step by step to configure all the required components and also points out the potential pitfalls. No more time to waste. Download the whitepaper Hybrid Cloud with [NVGRE (WSSC 2012 R2)](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Hybrid-Cloud-with-NVGRE-aa6e1e9a) and start exploring the world of Network Virtualization today!
