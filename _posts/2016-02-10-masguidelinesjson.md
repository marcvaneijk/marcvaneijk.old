title: Microsoft Azure Stack – Guidelines for contributing ARM templates
tags:
---
While everybody is installing the Technical Preview of Microsoft Azure Stack, I figured it might be a good idea to work on some guidelines for deploying ARM templates on Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview when the installation is completed. The guidelines are published as the README.md file in the azurestack-quickstart-templates repository on GitHub.

https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates

GitHub will automatically render and display the content of the README file. Just scroll to the bottom of the page.

The README.md contains information the following topics.

- What repository?
- Contribution Guide
- Azure Resource Manager limitations in Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview
- API Versions for Resource Providers
- Guidelines for Microsoft Azure Stack deployment templates (with samples)

Besides the README.md file I also added a sample README.md that you can use as a reference for your own deployment template. The link is mentioned in the README.md file but you can also access is directly.

https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/blob/master/Sample%20README.md

If you are not sure how to get it over to your own repository, just click on the “Raw” button on the top left of the menu bar and you can copy and paste it into your own README.md file.

You can also do this the GitHub way. If you are completely new to GitHub, have a look at [this blog](/2016/02/03/githubstart.html) to get started.

Thanks to Charles and Victor for reviewing.

Have fun contributing.
