title: Windows Azure Pack changing the default URLs
tags: 
---


With the General Availability of Windows Azure Pack more organizations are interested in or are already implementing the complete CloudOS. Compared to the previous release Microsoft has put more effort in documentation for the product. After you have implementing your first lab environment (and you should, before trying anything like this in production) you will see that the default URLs for accessing the Admin Site is configured on port 30091 and the Tenant Site is configured on port 30081. In the previous release of Windows Azure Pack (named Windows Azure Services for Windows Server) you could just change the port to 443 in IIS, assign a public certificate to the website and you were done.

In Windows Azure Pack Microsoft introduced the possibility to use Active Directory Federations Services (ADFS) for authentication. This functionality enables a single sign on experience for end users. ADFS (besides many other features) makes Windows Azure Pack also interesting for enterprise organizations wanting to provide “Service Provider like” offerings to their internal customers.

The integration of ADFS required some changes to the validation procedure within Windows Azure Pack. Even without configuring ADFS the Admin Site and the Tenant Site now have their own dedicated authentication sites. In this blog I’ll describe the required steps to change the default URLs (name and port number) to public URLs.

Installer

Before we start it is good to understand that it is not possible to have multiple sites on a single server listening on the same default SSL port 443. I have even tried to add additional IP addresses to the same server NIC and bind each Website to a different IP Address (all on port 443). This will work within the same subnet, but will not function when accessing through NAT externally. For this configuration we are looking at four websites.
•Admin Site 
•Admin Authentication Site 
•Tenant Site 
•Tenant Authentication Site 

If you want to access these sites externally over a default SSL connection on port 443 you would need a virtual machine for each website (four in total) and four public IP addresses. For a production environment you would not provide external access to the Admin Site. The Admin Site and the Admin Authentication Site can be installed on a single machine. The Tenant Site and the Tenant Authentication site are probably going to be accessed from the internet. You can use a wildcard certificate provided by a public Certificate Authority for all websites. For this blog I will reference three virtual machines.
•wap01 (Admin Site & Admin Authentication Site) 
•wap02 (Tenant Site) 
•wap03 (Tenant Authentication Site) 

In a more robust production environment you would double these servers and make their services high available with a Load Balancer (NLB or Hardware Load Balancer). I have verified that these configuration steps are the same for a scale out scenario using Load Balancing.

The Admin Site

In a default configuration the Admin Site is configured on port 30091 and the Admin Authentication Site is configured on port 30072. Accessing the the admin site through a browser can be divided in to the following seven steps.

Admin Default
1.You enter the NetBIOS name of the server with the port configured in IIS for the Admin Site 
2.Windows Azure Pack gets the Admin Site Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and port number from the database and notifies the browser 
3.The browser is redirected to the FQDN and port number of the Admin Site configured in the Windows Azure Pack database 
4.The Admin Site detects you do not have the correct token to validate and notifies the browser with the FQDN and port number of the Admin Authentication Site configured in the database 
5.The browser is redirected to the FQDN and port number configured for the Admin Authentication Site in the Windows Azure Pack database 
6.After validation a token is provided and the Admin Authentication Site gets the FQDN and port number from the database for the Admin Site and notifies the browser 
7.The browser is redirected to the FQDN and port number configured for the Admin Site

For this example I want access the Admin Site on https://admin.hyper-v.nu and the Admin Authentication Site on https://admin.hyper-v.nu:30072. I will describe each configuration step referencing the numbers in the picture.

•Compliancy and Remediation


In this part two Hyper-V hosts will be deployed. These hosts do not have any Operating System applied. A prerequisite for the Bare Metal Deployment process is that the hosts have their base management controller configured with a user account and an IP address, that is accessible from the System Center VMM 2012 R2 management server. In the deployment process you need to select a RunAs account that will connect to the base management controller, therefore it is recommended to configure the same set of credentials for the base management controller on each server. The host that you want to deploy should have network boot configured before disk boot in its boot order. You can change these settings in the BIOS.

In this blog series two logical switches, consisting of two physical NICs each, are configured on a host. The physical NICs in the servers should be connected to the correct VLANs. This might mean patching physical cables from a rack server to the switch or configuring virtual cabling in a blade chassis. No matter the configuration you need to know what networks are connected to which physical NIC. There are two possibilities to map the correct physical NICs to the logical switches. More recent servers support consistent device naming (CDN) that will consistently name NICs in the BIOS. Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 can read this information during deployment and name the NICs in the Operating System the same. The physical NIC port numbers in the Operating System will match the numbers on the physical NIC interfaces. For servers that do not support consistent device naming, System Center VMM 2012 R2 provides a feature called Deep Discovery. This optional step in the bare metal deployment process allows you to get information from the server by leveraging a PXE boot file provided by VMM.

Consistent Device Naming

If you server supports consistent device naming you can verify the CDN settings in the server BIOS. For this blog I’m using a C7000 chassis with a couple of G8 blades. In the advanced settings of the BIOS there is an entry Consistent Device Naming.

01 CDN Bios

Enabling support for CDN in the BIOS allows the Operating System to read the names from the BIOS during deployment. When the installation of the Operating System is complete the names of the Physical NICs are consistent with the port numbers on your rack server or blade.

02 NIC naming in OS

Deep Discovery

Not all servers support CDN. If your host does not support consistent device naming the wizard provides you with an option to run a deep discovery. This optional step will boot the host using the base management controller. We configured the host already to boot from the network (PXE boot) before it will boot from local disk. Deep discovery provides a Boot file leveraging the WDS server.

03 Deep Discovery PXE

The boot file will perform an inventory of the physical NICs (Name, Bandwidth, MAC address). This information can then be used to map logical switches to the correct Physical NICs. Deep discovery will take a couple of minutes to complete. So if your server supports CDN, you should use it to save some time (and we all have loads of that).


Bare Metal Deployment

No matter if you are using CDN to map the NICs to the correct logical switches in advance or use deep discovery to map the NICs to the correct logical switches during the deployment wizard, all other steps to deploy a hosts are the same. To add a new host to System Center VMM 2012 R2 with the bare metal process open the Fabric tab, select Add Resources and choose Hyper-V Hosts and Clusters. This will start the Add Resource Wizard. Select Physical computers to be provisioned as virtual machine hosts in the Resource location screen. In the Credentials and Protocol screen select the RunAs account that we created for the base management controller. For HP ILO the default protocol Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) on port 623 is correct.

The Discovery Scope screen allows you to enter a single IP address, an IP subnet or an IP range that will be used to connect to one or more base management controllers. The single IP address option allows you to skip the deep discovery process. If your host is configured for CDN you should checkmark the Skip deep discovery here. If your host does not support CDN you should verify that this checkmark is cleared.

04 Discovery Scope

Should you choose to install multiple host (by selecting IP subnet or IP range) you can select or deselect the deep discovery process in the following screen Target Resources.

05 Selected hosts

In the provisioning Options screen you can select to which Host Group you want to assign the hosts (in this example the host group Tenants). You also need to select the Host profile that we created in part 3 of this blog series (Hyper-V Host).

The Deployment Customization screen is where all the pieces of the puzzle fall in place. This is where the actual hardware is mapped to the logical switches.

06 Deep discovery

When you selected to run deep discovery you will have to wait until that process is complete. You can already configure the computer name. When deep discovery is complete or you are using CDN you can adjust Network Adapter settings of each host.

07 NIC Mappings

Consistent Device Naming configured in the Host Profile and supported by the host will map the Physical NICs to the correct logical switches. Deep discovery provides the MAC addresses of the Physical NICs in order for you to map them to the correct logical switches. To map a physical NIC to a logical switch select the … box next to the Physical NIC that you would like to map.

08 Logical Switch Mapping

Map the desired two NICs to the logical switch Management and two other NICs to the logical switch Tenants. As noted in the previous part of this series System Center VMM 2012 R2 Preview will not set the port classification correctly. Open the settings of each virtual adapter and verify that the appropriate port classifications is set.

09 Network Adapter IP Config

When the mapping of the network adapters is complete you can optionally specify to which disk the operating system will be applied. If you do not specify a disk on the disks tab, the first disk volume that System Center VMM 2012 R2 has access to will be used for the OS deployment.

When you are deploying multiple hosts (which might make sense considering the work to prepare for the bare metal deployment process) you must repeat the steps for each host if you are using deep discovery. So if you are buying new hosts make sure your they come with CDN. It will save you a lot of time and physical NIC mapping, especially if you are deploying multiple hosts.

Completing the wizard will start the bare metal deployment process on the hosts you selected. You can track the process in the jobs tab of the System Center VMM 2012 R2.

10 Job in progress

Take note that during the creation of the logical switches on the hosts the bare metal deployments process will wait for two minutes. Depending on the performance of your hardware and network a new host will be completely deployed and added to System Center VMM 2012 R2 in about 25 minutes. For those who have tested this process in System Center VMM 2012 SP1 and have failed to complete the process successfully every time I have included the screenshot with the job completed showing the creation of the logical switches in the job log. It really does work!!

11 Job complete

In the next and last part of this series we will verify the settings on the deployed hosts and perform management of the logical switches with compliancy and remediation.
